# The Chamber & EXP

The Chamber is the training camp for \[REDACTED] to earn experience and become stronger. It is another location (contract) that the \[REDACTED]s may enter. It is essentially a staking mechanism whereby a token is minted to stakers at a TBD rate.&#x20;

## EXP Token

EXP is minted to players who stake \[REDACTED] in The Chamber. We can discuss whether this is a pure mint or with the addition of buyback mechanism whereby the royalties earned from trading is used to buy EXP off secondary and distribute it to stakers.

The main use cases of EXP are as follows

1. Spend EXP to upgrade your \[REDACTED] at an increasingly expensive price (discuss maxing out, cosmetic upgrades etc.) --> This mech burns EXP, removing it from circulation and PAMP
2. Spend EXP to mint another \[REDACTED] at a constant price (more expensive than upgrading for the first few upgrades) --> Same thing, pumpamentals solid
