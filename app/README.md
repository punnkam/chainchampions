# \Chain Champions

\Chain Champions is an infinite on-chain battle royale with players fighting to win a share of a bounty. Each Champion has unique attributes suited for the varying terrains of the Arena. Champions favored by their attributes and Arena terrain are more likely to be crowned a winner of that battle (and corresponding bounty \$$$). Championss can enter the Battle Camp to increase their rating, get some cosmetic boosts, and increase their chances of taking home the bounty. Individual Champions are stored completely on-chain along with the # of battles and $ of bounty won, making those battle records immutable for the rest of time.&#x20;
