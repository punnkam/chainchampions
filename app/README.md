# \[REDACTED] Game

\[REDACTED] Game is an infinite on-chain battle royale fought by 8888 \[REDACTED]s, each fighting to win a share of a bounty. Each \[REDACTED] has unique attributes suited for the varying terrains of the Arena. \[REDACTED]s favored by their attributes and Arena terrain are more likely to be crowned a winner of that battle (and corresponding bounty \$$$). \[REDACTED]s can enter the Battle Camp to increase their rating, get some cosmetic boosts, and increase their chances of taking home the bounty. Individual \[REDACTED]s are stored completely on-chain along with the # of battles and $ of bounty won, making those battle records immutable for the rest of time.&#x20;
