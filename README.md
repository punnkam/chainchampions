# \[REDACTED] Game

Refer to this https://docs.olympusdao.finance/main/ for structure

\[REDACTED] Game is an infinite on-chain battle royale fought by 8888 \[REDACTED]s, each fighting to win a share of a bounty. Each \[REDACTED] has unique attributes suited for the varying terrains of the Arena. \[REDACTED]s favored by their attributes and Arena terrain are more likely to be crowned a winner of that battle (and corresponding bounty \$$$). \[REDACTED]s can enter the Battle Camp to increase their rating, get some cosmetic boosts, and increase their chances of taking home the bounty. Individual \[REDACTED]s are stored completely on-chain along with the # of battles and $ of bounty won, making those battle records immutable for the rest of time.&#x20;

## Need to develop some sort of meme&#x20;

Trying to get the effect similar to OHM (3, 3). If ur unfamiliar just search up olympus 3,3



FYI, we don't have to implement everything right away. In crypto there's merit to being mysterious and having a roadmap lmao. Also we don't want to just grind this all out before we test the mkt.
