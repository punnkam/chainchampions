## Player Goals

Players (people who own a \[REDACTED]) can be split up into two categories:

1. Players with high rating \[REDACTED]&#x20;
2. Players with low rating \[REDACTED] &#x20;

Players that are 1. may play their \[REDACTED] in the Arena or enter the Battle Camp. It is unknown which strategy is optimal. I personally think the Arena could be more profitable but upgrading the first few times might be profitable.&#x20;

Players that are 2. may play their \[REDACTED] in the Arena or enter the Battle Camp. It is unknown which strategy is optimal. I personally think the Battle Camp would be most optimal as you could upgrade a mediocre character or mint a better character if the players are super bad.

Also, people can buy $XP from DEXes and that would be beneficial to the whole ecosystem.

In addition to the bounty and farming incentives, \[REDACTED]s stores the battle record indefinitely. Therefore, good battle records should increase the secondary sale price of a \[REDACTED]. Collectors may also favor low rating \[REDACTED]s with good battle records.
